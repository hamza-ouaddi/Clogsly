Clogsly, a shoes store landing page created by HTML &amp; CSS

A product landing page I made during my learning path with practicing on projects. In this webpage, I used HTML and CSS; the hardest part I faced while creating this webpage is the use of CSS Grid, especially in the gallery section. Even though, I succeeded in making the layout of the gallery section as I wanted by CSS Grid. If you have some feedback, please feel free, and thanks!
